# Start the sha3x GPU miner

Now we're ready to run glytex.

Once again, you'll need to replace "123456789" with the address you saved from the "Tari Address interactive"
field in the console_wallet.

```console
./glytex --engine=opencl --tari-node-url=http://127.0.0.1:18142 \
  --tari-address="123456789"
```

You should see output similar to this:

```console
TODO
```
