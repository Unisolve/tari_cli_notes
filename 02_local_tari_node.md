# Start the local tari node

Create a new Linux window and start the node:

```console

```

If you're asked:

```console
Node identity does not exist.
Would you like to create one (Y/n)?
```

answer "Y"

Once the node is running, you can enter control-c at any time to call up the command
prompt and enter commands. For example:

```console
version
```

or

```console
list-peers
```

or 
```console

```
