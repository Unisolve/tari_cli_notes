# Introduction
 
These notes cover mining Tari on the Linux command line. They are not part of the Tari project
and have been produced in the hope that you'll find them useful. The setup documented here assumes 
a Linux server running Ubuntu 22.04 with one or more GPUs. For simplicity, we'll be using 
the console wallet and we will be mining solo. Pool mining will be covered in a separate guide.

We'll also assume that you're only interested in mining on the Tari mainnet. 

These notes don't assume that you have a Linux desktop available to you. The command line 
is all you need. *Please be aware that at present these notes are incomplete but I hope to address more of 
the topic over time.*
